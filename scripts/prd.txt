# Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk:** Complexity of building a full-featured Admin Panel.
    - **Mitigation:** Break down admin features into smaller, manageable tasks as per the roadmap. Start with core photo management.
- **Risk:** Integrating Supabase services (Auth, DB, Storage, Functions) might have a learning curve.
    - **Mitigation:** Allocate specific time for learning/prototyping Supabase features. Utilize Supabase documentation and community support.
- **Risk:** Ensuring optimal performance with many high-resolution images.
    - **Mitigation:** Implement robust lazy loading, responsive image techniques (e.g., `srcset`), and potentially utilize Supabase Storage image transformations if needed.
- **Risk:** Scope creep adding unplanned features.
    - **Mitigation:** Adhere strictly to the defined roadmap phases. Evaluate new feature requests against project goals and timelines, potentially moving them to future enhancements.
